how to add a new row to a df in panda?EditTo add a new row to a DataFrame in pandas, you have several options. Here are two common methods:


==
Using loc[] with a new index:
import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'df'
new_row = {'column1': value1, 'column2': value2, ...}
df.loc[len(df)] = new_row

==
Using concat():

import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'df'
new_row = pd.DataFrame({'column1': [value1], 'column2': [value2], ...})
df = pd.concat([df, new_row], ignore_index=True)
The loc[] method is generally faster for adding a single row, while concat() can be more efficient for adding multiple rows at once.
